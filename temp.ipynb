    "## Overview\n",
    "Colossal-AI is an open-source deep learning system designed for efficient, large-scale parallel training of neural network models. Developed to simplify the complexities involved in training large models across multiple GPUs and nodes, Colossal-AI provides a high-level interface and toolkits that integrate seamlessly with popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. It facilitates the implementation of various parallelism strategies, such as tensor parallelism, data parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and hybrid parallelism, thereby enabling researchers and practitioners to scale their models beyond the constraints of single-device capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "The primary purpose of Colossal-AI is to make the massive-scale model training accessible for general public, which was previously limited to well-resourced organizations due to hardware and complexity constraints. It aims to provide an easy-to-use, flexible, and efficient platform that allows users to train extremely large models with reduced coding overhead and optimized resource usage. By abstracting the underlying complexity of parallel computation, it enables users to focus more on model development rather than on parallelization details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application\n",
    "Colossal-AI is applicable in scenarios where training large models is essential, such as in natural language processing (e.g., training transformer models like GPT and BERT), computer vision, and other domains requiring significant computational power and memory. It supports various applications, ranging from academic research to industrial deployments, where the training of large and complex models is crucial for advancing state-of-the-art performances and developing innovative solutions.\n",
